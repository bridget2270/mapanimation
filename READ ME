Project: Bus Map Animation
This project shows a map of the Boston, MA area. The map starts off with one marker set at the coordinates for the first bus stop. 
Once the button in the top left corner "Show Stops Between MIT and Harvard" is clicked the marker will start moving through each stop from MIT to Harvard, University.
